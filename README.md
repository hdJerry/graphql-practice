# graphql-practice
_This is a practice to understand how graphql work by using some dependencies like express, graphql, mongoose and graphql-express_

### Steps For Server side
- navigate in to the server folder
```
cd server
```
- install dependencies
```
npm install
```
PS: You might need to install nodemon or any package of your choice to run the serve
```
npm install nodemon -g
```
- Finally run the app
```
nodemon app
```
Note: You will also need to setup you mongoDB. You can also test with mongodbAtlas
visit [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- return to the data file in the schema folder and substitute your mongoDB URI with mine.

**Happy Coding**
